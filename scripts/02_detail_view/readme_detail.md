# EXECUTION PLAN

**SQUARESPACE WORK**
1. Data will be scraped in Squarespace Footer Code Injection to generate a raw object of all the product details. This will be sent to dataLayer with event key `ssRawProductDetailJSONPushed_ss` and variable key `ssRawProductDetailJSON`
    Add code to Squarespace's Code Injection in the "Footer" section. This code will scrub the page for all scripts and find the one with the Squarespace Context object `Static.SQUARESPACE_CONTEXT`, which has all the product detail information

    [How to scrape information from SS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58053572/scraping-information-from-a-script-tag-using-javascript/64887166#64887166)

    then this object will be split and loaded into an object with a key containing information to the item and a key containing informtion on the product variants

```
            ssRawProductDetailJSON = {
                "item": ssContextObject.item,
                "product": ssContextObject.product
            };
```

    this is pushed to the dataLayer with event `ssRawProductDetailJSONPushed_ss`


**GTM WORK**
1. create a DL variable to hold the variable pushed from Squarespace -- `{{DL - SS Raw Product Detail JSON}}`

2. Write a script that takes this DL variable and generates a proper eec.detail object and uses a utility to add the "actionField" with "list" if appropriate

3. Create a utility function that will add the "actionField" with "list" that the user last viewed -- `{{JS Utility - add list from referrer}}` (NOTE: this utility relies on another utility to parse the URI of the referrer `{{JS Utility - parseURI}}`)
